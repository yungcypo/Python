# Python
Random/small Python projects that weren't worth a separate repository

## Projects  
[Age Calc](/age_calc.py) -  
[Atbash Cipher](/atbash_cipher.py) - encoding algorith - replaces A <=> Z, B <=> Y, C <=> X and so on... Thanks [ZekoSNB](https://github.com/ZekoSNB) for inspiration on this one  
[Chessboard](/chessboard.py) - you place 1â‚¬ on 1st square of chessboard, once as much on 2nd square, once as much on 3rd square and so on. This program calculates how much you will have on the last one   
[Height Calc](/height_calc.py) - enter your height and be surprised :)
